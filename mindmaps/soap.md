    Used to exchange data between "web services"

   Can also be used to call remote object's methods

   Data schemas and Remote objects are defined by XML, so it's not limited to a single prog. language

   Usually, the XML definitions are created automatically by using tools like "javax.xml.ws"

   Can be replaced by modern alternatives like gRPC
